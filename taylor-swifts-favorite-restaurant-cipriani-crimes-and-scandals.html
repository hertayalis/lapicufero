They treated the stars like gold and the rest of the people were expendable,” DeGroff said.&nbsp;</p><p>The family’s high society ties began in 1931, when Giuseppe Cipriani snr. opened Harry’s Bar in Venice, welcoming Ernest Hemingway, Truman Capote and Katherine Hepburn and becoming a dolce vita destination in the floating city for artists, writers and aristocrats.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The Cipriani family’s high society ties began in 1931, when Giuseppe Cipriani snr. opened Harry’s Bar in Venice.
