In other words, if you split anything into one hundred equal pieces, 4 hundredths represents four of those parts that you have just divided up. Because four hundredths equals four times one hundred, four hundredths as a fraction is four hundredths of a hundred. You may represent the decimal equivalent of four hundredths as 0.04 by dividing it by one hundred.
How can you express hundredths as a decimal number, taking this into consideration?</description></item><item><title>Marty Smith Biography, Wife, Parents, Brother, Family, Net Worth</title><link>/marty-smith-bio-wife-parents-brother-family-net-worth.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/marty-smith-bio-wife-parents-brother-family-net-worth.html</guid><description>Marty Smith is a household name in the sports world.&amp;nbsp;He stands out as one of ESPN’s most famous and respected hosts and reporters.&amp;nbsp;Among other things, he reports several sporting events for ESPN such as auto racing, basketball, and soccer.
