Her voice and demeanor were well-practiced, believable and, as a result, Globe-worthy.<br><b>Signature Style</b> You could call her a conservative risk-taker on the red carpet. Her choices are always unique, not usually in sync with the trend du jour, but always stunning. She tends to veer toward metallics or basic, albeit strong, black.<br><b>This Look</b> Giorgio Armani, a favorite designer of the Aussie actress, calls her "serene, confident and elegant." In one of his beautiful creations, the expectant mother fits his description perfectly.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-julie-christie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Julie Christie</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sylvain Gaboury/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">BEST PERFORMANCE BY AN ACTRESS IN A MOTION PICTURE, DRAMA</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>The Award</b> Her role as a wife who begins to suffer from Alzheimer's in Away From Her was anything but unforgettable for the Hollywood Foreign Press, who bestowed 66-year-old Christie with her first win and her fourth nomination.<br><b>Signature Style</b> A bit of a reluctant celebrity, Christie has never owned a clothes dryer (she prefers to hang-dry, as it's more environmentally friendly). She has said, "I love to see other people looking beautiful, but I'm not someone who likes dressing up." While her style at the time was very '60s mod, these days it's not as easily defined. Sometimes she dabbles in colorful combinations; sometimes she opts for basic black.<br><b>This Look</b> For the New York premiere of Away From Her, Christie offered a little nod to her mod phase with black tights under her green dress.

"Black is me-and it's easy since I don't have time to put that much thought into clothes," says Jolie.

Neither can we. Always dapper, never flashy, Clooney in a tux deserves a head-to-toe scan every time.<br><b>This Look</b> It almost seems unfair how beautiful an Armani suit looks on the actor, who wore one to the Critics' Choice Awards earlier this month.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-golden-globe-winner-viggo-mortensen></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Golden Globe Winner - Viggo Mortensen</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>SplashNewsOnline.com</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">BEST PERFORMANCE BY AN ACTOR IN A MOTION PICTURE, DRAMA</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>The Award</b>] The actor best known for his roles in Lord of the Rings and A History of Violence can now add Golden Globe winner to his resume.

A first-time nominee and winner, McAvoy's turn as Robbie Turner in Atonement struck a chord with audiences, as did those piercing blue eyes.<br><b>Signature Style</b> When he hits the red carpet, McAvoy tends to be unfussy, with a bit of facial scruff and the top few buttons on his shirt undone.
