Thus, none of her father's other children are her full siblings. However, she does not see them as such, as she calls them "amazing," and the close-knit family often spends holidays and vacations together.</p><p class=dh>Maggie Johnson is the mother of Francesca's half-siblings, Kyle and Alison. Jacelyn Reeves is the mother of Francesca's other half-brother and sister, Scott and Kathryn. Dina Ruiz is Francesca's half-sister Morgan's mother, and the mother of her other sister, Laurie Murray, is unknown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ed504bfb086f69ffe483a34631cf799b.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Clint Eastwood with Alison and Kathryn Eastwood at the 62nd annual Golden Globe Awards show on January 16, 2005, in Beverly Hill. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Laurie Murray Hired Specialists to Find Her Parents</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Laurie, the eldest of Francesca's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://parade.com/1261389/debrawallace/clint-eastwood-children/>half-siblings</a>, discovered Clint was her father when she was in her thirties.
