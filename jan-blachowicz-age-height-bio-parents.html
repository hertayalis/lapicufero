Though by education and trade, he is a civil engineering technician and plumber, he never involved himself in these as he had always been interested in sports since his childhood days.</p><p>Juan Blachowicz fights out of Warsaw, Poland but is originally from Cieszyn, Poland.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jan Blachowicz Parents</h2><p>Very little is known about his early life, his parents, and his siblings, and it seems he likes to keep those pieces of information to himself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jan Blachowicz Siblings</h2><p>Unknown</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jan Blachowicz Wife</h2><p>He is happily married to his wife Dorota Jurkowska.</p><p>It has been reported that Jan is dating fellow Polish MMA fighter Lukasz Jurkowski’s sister named Dorota and has moved together to Warshaw, Poland. He has often shared her pictures in his social media profiles and has also mentioned her name in the biography of his Facebook page. Very little is known about her and about how long they had been in a relationship.

In the co-main event, we have a fight in the light heavyweight division between No. 3 ranked Jan Blachowicz and former middleweight champion Alex Pereira to see who could potentially be contending for the light heavyweight title.</p><p>Jan Blachowicz has been a professional mixed martial arts fighter since 2007 and cut his cloth on the Polish regional scene before making his UFC debut in 2014 after getting signed as the KSW Light Heavyweight Champion.</p><p>Jan won KSW Light Heavyweight Championship on November 26, 2011.
