At the height of her career in the 1930s, West was one of the highest-paid people in the United States, according to a 1937 Time magazine article.</p><p>West began her career in vaudeville and on stage in New York, where she became known for her use of double entendres. She moved to Hollywood in 1930 to pursue her acting career and starred in films such as “I’m No Angel,” “Every Day’s a Holiday,” and “My Little Chickadee.” She also wrote and starred in several Broadway plays, including “Sex,” “Diamond Lil,” and “Catherine Was Great.”</p><p>West was also a singer, releasing several albums throughout her career. She published several books, including “The Wit and Wisdom of Mae West” and “Goodness Had Nothing to Do with It.”</p><p>West was often the subject of censorship issues, but continued to perform in Las Vegas and the United Kingdom after her film career ended. She passed away at the age of 87 in 1980, three months after suffering a stroke.</p><h2><span id=Mae_Wests_Early_Life_and_Career>Mae West’s Early Life and Career</span></h2><p>Mae West was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1893. She grew up with two younger siblings and began performing at the age of five. By age 14, West became a vaudeville performer with the Hal Clarendon Stock Company.</p><p>During her youth, West’s family lived in various parts of Queens and Brooklyn. Her first professional performance was at Neir’s Social Hall in Woodhaven, and she competed in local talent shows, often winning prizes.</p><p>West used the stage name “Baby Mae” in the early days of her career. She continued to perform and entertain audiences throughout her life, becoming an iconic figure in American entertainment.</p><h2><span id=Mae_Wests_Career_Highlights>Mae West’s Career Highlights</span></h2><p>In 1911, Mae West made her Broadway debut in “A La Broadway” and received critical praise. She co-starred with Al Jolson in “Vera Violetta” later that year and appeared in “A Winsome Widow” in 1912. In 1918, she starred in the revue “Sometime” and her photo was featured on the sheet music for “Ev’rybody Shimmies Now.” Mae wrote risqué plays under the name “Jane Mast,” including “Sex,” which she also produced, directed, and starred in. She was arrested and jailed for eight days for morals charges related to the play. In the late ’20s and early ’30s, Mae brought several plays to Broadway, including “The Wicked Age,” “Diamond Lil,” “The Pleasure Man,” and “The Constant Sinner.” She signed a contract with Paramount Pictures in 1932 and appeared in her first film, “Night After Night,” where she was allowed to rewrite some of her character’s lines. Mae’s most successful film was “She Done Him Wrong” in 1933, which was based on “Diamond Lil” and also starred Cary Grant. She also co-wrote “I’m No Angel” with Harlan Thompson, which also starred Cary Grant.</p><h2><span id=Mae_Wests_Acting_Career_and_Earnings>Mae West’s Acting Career and Earnings</span></h2><p>Mae West wrote and starred in several films including “Belle of the Nineties,” “Goin’ to Town,” “Klondike Annie,” “Go West, Young Man,” “Every Day’s a Holiday,” and “My Little Chickadee.” She also appeared in “The Heat’s On” in 1943. By the mid-1930s, Mae West was the highest-paid actress in the world and one of the highest-paid people overall in the United States. In 1935, she earned $480,000, the same as $10.5 million today after adjusting for inflation. The only person who earned more in the US in 1935 was newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who earned $500,000.</p><h2><span id=Mae_Wests_Career_Highlights1>Mae West’s Career Highlights</span></h2><p>Mae West faced years of censorship by the film industry, leading to a hiatus in movie-making until her return in 1970 for “Myra Breckinridge” and her final film “Sextette” in 1978. During her time away from movies, she wrote and starred in “Catherine Was Great” on Broadway, staged several revivals of “Diamond Lil,” and had her own stage show at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas in the ’50s. In the ’60s, she appeared on “The Red Skelton Hour” and “Mister Ed.” Mae also released an album in 1972 called “Great Balls of Fire,” featuring covers of popular songs.</p><h2><span id=Mae_Wests_Relationships>Mae West’s Relationships</span></h2><p>In 1909, Mae married Frank Szatkus, but they kept it a secret. Mae met Guido Deiro in 1913 and married him in 1914, but the relationship ended after Guido found out that Mae had aborted their child. Mae had a relationship with her manager, James Timony, in 1916, but they remained close friends until his death in 1954. After Mae’s mother died in 1930, she moved to Hollywood and provided for her family. Mae lived in her Ravenswood apartment until her death in 1980 and had a relationship with Chester Rybinski, a muscle man in her Vegas show, until her death.</p><h2><span id=Mae_Wests_Death_and_Funeral>Mae West’s Death and Funeral</span></h2><p>In August 1980, Mae West lost her ability to speak after tripping while getting out of bed. She was taken to L.A.’s Good Samaritan Hospital, where tests revealed that she had suffered a stroke. Mae West passed away at the age of 87 on November 22, 1980. A private funeral service was held on November 25th at the church at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills, where Mae was laid to rest in the family mausoleum at Brooklyn’s Cypress Hills Abbey.</p><h2><span id=Accolades_for_Mae_West>Accolades for Mae West</span></h2><p>1969: Named Female Star of the Year at the Golden Apple Awards.</p><p>1960: Received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Motion Picture.</p><p>1999: Voted #15 on the American Film Institute’s “100 Years…100 Stars” list, which ranked American cinema’s top 25 female and top 25 male screen legends.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC5wJ5ksJ2jqXqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmae-west-net-worth.html&text=Mae%20West%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmae-west-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmae-west-net-worth.html&title=Mae%20West%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmae-west-net-worth.html&title=Mae%20West%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmae-west-net-worth.html&title=Mae%20West%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmae-west-net-worth.html&description=Mae%20West%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./youtube-host.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Matt DAvella Age Birthday, Wife, Wiki, Height, Biceps, Net Worth, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kaylee-campbell-layton-and-ryan-laytons-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kaylee Campbell Layton And Ryan Layton's Relationship">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
