I don’t know myself if I can survive this heartache,” daughter Allison Tripp Foley had written on Tuesday in a since-removed Facebook post, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Post</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Foley continued: “Please pray for a painless process for the strongest woman I will ever know in my entire lifetime.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She fought on as hard as she could,” son-in-law Thomas Foley told the Post on Wednesday, adding, “I know all the press will focus on the other stuff, but she was a special person and a fantastic grandparent who was devoted to her family. People forget this part.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">PEOPLE’s efforts to reach her family were not successful.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although the cause of Rausch’s death was not known, her daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told TMZ</a> that it was unrelated to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>novel coronavirus pandemic</a>. Rausch previously survived breast cancer, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>her mother told CNN</a> she had recently been diagnosed with cancer in her pancreas and lymph nodes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Daughter Allison, an accomplished equestrienne and real estate agent, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>was reportedly</a> at her mother’s deathbed in intensive care along with Dieter Rausch, Linda’s husband.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">(DailyMail.com <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>first reported news of her death</a> on Wednesday; the Post first reported she was seriously ill.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Linda rose to prominence — and, for some, infamy — in 1998 when she revealed information about the president’s affair after having grown close with the 20-something Lewinsky, a former intern who was moved from the White House to the Pentagon but continued her burgeoning relationship with Clinton.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With Linda, Lewinsky shared intimate details about her time with the president.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amid an investigation into Clinton’s conduct with another woman, Paula Jones, Linda turned over some 22 hours of taped phone conversations with Lewinsky, who first opened up to Linda in 1996 — describing her dalliances with the married commander-in-chief inside the White House.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Facebook</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Linda recorded her calls with Lewinsky, without Lewinsky’s knowledge, and shared what she knew of the relationship with independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who was investigating Clinton.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Linda began taping Lewinsky in the fall of 1997 and gave the recordings to authorities in January 1998. She received immunity for her cooperation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That evidence, including some 22 hours of audio and a semen-stained blue dress worn by Lewinsky, was used against Clinton and he was impeached by the House of Representatives. The Senate, however, acquitted him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Linda’s protracted stratagem — sometimes talking with Lewinsky for hours, in great detail — as well as her work in President George H. W. Bush’s administration and her association with a book agent for a possible Clinton White House exposé opened her up to criticism that she was partisan and self-interested rather than righteous, tossing aside someone she had pretended to befriend for her own motives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While testifying before the grand jury convened to investigate Clinton, Lewinsky said, “I’m really sorry for everything that’s happened. And I hate Linda Tripp.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, her former friend insisted, she was uncovering something she couldn’t abide.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That book agent who encouraged her to record Lewinsky, Lucianne Goldberg, has said she did so in order to help Linda protect herself from any claims that she was lying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was fascinated,” Linda <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told ABC News in 2001</a>. “I couldn’t believe — could he [Clinton] be that reckless? Could he be that arrogantly reckless to philander with a child? I was reeling from the horror of it all.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She said in 2003 that she hoped Lewinsky could move on with dignity in her life: “I would wish for her the same thing I would wish for my daughter: self respect, a sense of self, the ability to make the right choices in life.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even so, she has said the two were not truly ever friends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lewinsky, now 46, tweeted on Wednesday about Linda’s health problems before news of her death broke.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“No matter the past, upon hearing that Linda Tripp is very seriously ill, I hope for her recovery,” Lewinsky <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote</a>. “I can’t imagine how difficult this is for her family.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Linda spoke out only sporadically in the years since Clinton’s scandal. She split from husband Bruce Tripp in 1991, married Dieter in 2004 and re-settled in the Middleburg, Virginia, area outside Washington, D.C. The Pentagon had dismissed her from her job as a political appointee in 2001, on the last day of the Clinton administration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Linda spent years resolving other legal issues after making the Lewinsky tapes: She sued the government, claiming they violated her privacy, and received a six figure-settlement in 2003; charges in Maryland that she illegally recorded Lewinsky were dropped in 2000 because Lewinsky was barred from testifying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She moved on from her longtime home in suburban Maryland after the years of scrutiny became too much — for her, children Allison and Ryan and their neighbors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We essentially had to abandon it because it became a tourist trap, a tabloid haven,” she told PEOPLE in 2003.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of farm life in Northern Virginia with 16 horses, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Page Six in 2017</a>: “It’s paradise with complete autonomy and privacy, and that’s how I like it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Linda and her husband, who fell in love decades after first meeting during summers in Frankfort, Germany, also ran a Christmas shop, according to a previous PEOPLE report.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Starting in late 1999, she underwent expensive — and extensive — plastic surgery, bankrolled by an anonymous benefactor. Indeed, the verbal slings and arrows hurled at her because of her ’90s appearance (including John Goodman’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Saturday Night Live impersonation</a>) seemed to take their toll.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The notion of betrayal is ridiculous,” Linda told PEOPLE in 2003. “If I had looked perky, sweet and cute, I wouldn’t have been defined the way I was by the press.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2018, in what seems to have been her last public appearance, Linda gave the keynote address during National Whistleblower Day on Capitol Hill. She said again that her exposure of Clinton’s conduct had little to do with politics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She lamented the toll her role in the scandal took on her life, noting that it was “virtually impossible to get your good name back,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Washington Post reported</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There’s nothing quite like it,” she said, “and there’s nothing that can prepare you for it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As she had told PEOPLE in 2003: “You don’t spend 22 years of your life taking pride in working for the federal government, doing a great job and — I don’t want to sound like a flag-waver — but feeling a sense of duty … and then throw it out with the baby and the bathwater. You take it very seriously.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There are people who think I’m a hero, and there are people who think I’m a villain,” she said then. “And I’m neither.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>with The Daily Mail in 2015</a>, Linda castigated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Hillary Clinton</a> amid the latter’s presidential campaign. And she said she wasn’t sorry she spoke up about Lewinsky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I regret what I put my children through. I regret very much that they had to endure that level of vitriol,” she told the Mail. “But would I do it again? Yes.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>• With reporting by WENDY GROSSMAN KANTOR</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CkuarAyJyqaKSZo7GiedOroKmoXZmyorCO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flinda-tripp-dead.html&text=Bill%20Clinton%20Whistleblower%20Was%2070&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flinda-tripp-dead.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flinda-tripp-dead.html&title=Bill%20Clinton%20Whistleblower%20Was%2070" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flinda-tripp-dead.html&title=Bill%20Clinton%20Whistleblower%20Was%2070" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flinda-tripp-dead.html&title=Bill%20Clinton%20Whistleblower%20Was%2070" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flinda-tripp-dead.html&description=Bill%20Clinton%20Whistleblower%20Was%2070" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ian-huntleys-daughter-wants-first-31583810.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ian Huntley's daughter 'wants first meeting to ask for truth about Soham child murders'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wout-weghorst-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Wout Weghorst Parents?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
