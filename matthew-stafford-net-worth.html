Worth</h3><p>An American football quarterback, Matthew Stafford’s net worth as of December 2023 is an enormous <strong>$80 million</strong>.</p><p>His net worth is largely composed of NFL salaries, with a few million coming from brand endorsement deals.</p><p>Stafford is one of the highest-paid NFL players in the world currently, with more than <strong>$40 million</strong> in annual compensation.</p><p>With his massive annual salary, Stafford ranks sixth in the highest-paid NFL players list, tying the spot with Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>Similarly, the quarterback has also been a frequent guest in Forbes’s list of highest-earning athletes over the years.</p><p>In 2022 alone, Matthew raked in <strong>$72.3 million</strong> from NFL salaries and endorsements, which was enough to make him the <a href=#>13th highest-paid athlete globally</a>.</p><p>Out of the total amount, he made <strong>$69.8 million</strong> on the field, and the remaining amount of <strong>$2.5 million</strong> came off the field.</p><p>He even surpassed fellow quarterback for Green Bay Packers, <a href=#>Aaron Rodgers</a>, and golfer <a href=#>Tiger Woods</a> among others, with astonishing earnings.</p><h3>NFL Contracts</h3><h4>Detroit Lions</h4><p>After getting drafted by Detroit Lions in 2009, Matthew signed six years <strong>$72 million</strong> rookie contract.</p><p>With <strong>$48,400,000</strong> guaranteed on the sign and a total guarantee of the same amount, his average annual salary was<strong> $12 million</strong> as per the

million</strong> total guaranteed, and an average annual salary of <strong>$17,666,667.</strong></p><p>The extension also paid <strong>$27.5 million</strong> as a signing bonus to Matthew.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MatthewLions.jpg><p>With each season, Matthew was making money hand over fist, but his big payday was yet to come.</p><p>In 2017, Stafford signed yet another extension with the team, only this time, his contract was worth a staggering <strong>$135 million,</strong> one of the highest-paid contracts at the time.</p><p>The five-year contract came with a whopping <strong>$50 million</strong> signing bonus, <strong>$60.5 million</strong> guaranteed at signing, and <strong>$92 million</strong> in total guaranteed.</p><p>Similarly, the contract paid him an average annual salary of <strong>$27 million.</strong></p><h4>Los Angeles Rams</h4><p>In 2021, Matthew was traded to Los Angeles Rams with two seasons remaining in the ongoing five years contract.</p><p>Nevertheless, Stafford signed a four-year, <strong>$160 million</strong> contract with the Los Angeles Rams in March 2022, including a <strong>$60 million</strong> signing bonus and <strong>$130 million</strong> guaranteed.</p><p>Similarly, his average annual salary, according to the contract, is <strong>$40 million.</strong></p><p>In 2022, Stafford earned a base salary of <strong>$1.5 million</strong> and a signing bonus of <strong>$60 million</strong>&nbsp;while carrying a cap hit of <strong>$13.5 million</strong> and a dead cap value of <strong>$63 million.</strong></p><p>Likewise, the next year his base salary will remain the same with a cap hit of <strong>$20 million</strong> and a dead cap value of <strong>$49.5 million.</strong></p><p>However, in the 2024 season, Stafford will earn a base salary of <strong>$31 million</strong>, <strong>$27 million</strong> in 2025, and<strong> $26 million</strong> in 2026.</p><p>In addition to these, Matthew will get a <strong>$5 million</strong> in

salaries, <strong>$77.5 million</strong> in signing bonuses, <strong>$12 million</strong> in roster bonuses, <strong>$1.5 million</strong> in workout bonuses, and <strong>$32.83 million</strong> in

Suspensions</h3><p>Astonishingly, unlike most of the players in the NFL, Matthew Stafford has forfeited money just on one count.</p><p>On November 18, 2011, he forfeited <strong>$7,500</strong> for
