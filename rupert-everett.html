He was such a success they shot nearly 20 more minutes of him. And a mystery man scripted to sweep Julia Roberts' character off her feet gave way to allow the handsome gay best friend to reappear instead. Considered by many an overnight success when he gained worldwide fame with the role, Rupert had actually spent 20 years on the path to Hollywood.</p><h2>Rupert Everett's early life and career</h2><p id=e4EFgCvBlls data-wc=65>Born on May 29, 1959, in Norfolk, England, the son of an army officer-turned-businessman, Rupert attended boarding institutions from the age of seven, including a school in a Benedictine monastery, which he left aged 15. By then, he said, "I wanted to be a star. I would spend my whole time pretending I was being photographed by paparazzi and stuff, or bowing at curtain calls."</p><p id=eFwaERI6aEM data-wc=84>Within years he began studying at London's Central School For Speech And Drama, but he was thrown out at 19, he says, for reasons he couldn't recall. "I don't remember, to be honest," he said previously. "I just think they didn't think I was very good." He followed up touring with the Citizens Theatre Company of Glasgow, leaving formal education behind. "I think you get training all through your career," explained Rupert. "I don't think you get that much of it in drama school."</p><p id=eIgjICehzZX data-wc=86>He was 25 when he had his first taste of fame, gaining rave reviews for his 1984 film debut in . But believing there was "really no place" for him in UK films, Rupert soon decided to look for opportunities elsewhere. He headed to the Continent, and, fluent in French and Italian, made nearly a dozen movies. "The thing is, none of these things were exported out of Europe. England doesn't recognise Europe. America doesn't even know about Europe. So in those terms, I disappeared."</p><p id=ej95rjyacFk data-wc=100>While living in France and&nbsp;Italy, he began to concentrate on writing (the results are two published novels, and ). And in 1994, the 6ft 4in green-eyed Brit got back into the film game with and . His re-emergence on the scene came five years after he told the world he was gay, in doing so becoming one of cinema's few openly gay stars. Of course, coming from a little-known actor, the announcement wasn't exactly&nbsp;front-page news. "It's not being groundbreaking," he said, "When no-one's looking."</p><p id=eQYCXh0lO4P data-wc=124>Eight years after coming out, he won the role in without an audition and became known as the scene stealer though he prefers the term "scene enhancer" of the comedy. His newfound popularity meant his much-discussed sexual past was once again a hot topic, but Rupert met questions with his usual frankness. "What's the point in lying?" he said. "I want to have a long career in America, and not find myself facing skeletons in the closet." Addressing issues head-on is something Rupert didn't shy away from, answering questions about his sexuality as easily as he talks about the three albums he's recorded which you can find, he stated previously, "in funny little shops in London where they have oddities".</p><h2>Rupert Everett's later career</h2><p id=e2lpCSLZNDxn data-wc=60>Since then, the actor has continued his winning career streak, landing a second Golden Globe nomination for An Ideal Husband and starring in 2002's He combined TV offerings like 2004's with&nbsp;big-screen&nbsp;efforts such as</p><p id=eZn1t1AdAPb5 data-wc=24>His other more recent credits include stage productions such as ; films like and TV shows including</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9rcWdkv7a8xKurZp2mmr%2BmwNNo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frupert-everett.html&text=Rupert%20Everett%20-%20Biography&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frupert-everett.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frupert-everett.html&title=Rupert%20Everett%20-%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frupert-everett.html&title=Rupert%20Everett%20-%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frupert-everett.html&title=Rupert%20Everett%20-%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frupert-everett.html&description=Rupert%20Everett%20-%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sharon-tate-net-worth-210745.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sharon Tate Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./187088-lauren-london-give-loving-tribute-to-nipsey-hussles-sister-samantha-smith-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lauren London Pens Loving Tribute To Nipsey Hussle's Sister Samantha Smith">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
