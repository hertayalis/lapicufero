While she’s been involved in Marvel movies for a number of years, she has some pretty big shoes to fill in taking on the role of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Panther</a>, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wakanda Forever</a> proved that she’s up to the task. Her new role has many wondering about the rising star, how much is she earning, how old is she, etc. So, here’s everything we know about Letitia Wright.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-letitia-wright-s-childhood-and-early-roles data-injectable=false>Letitia Wright’s childhood and early roles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Letitia-Wright-Holby-City.jpg><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Currently only 29 years old, Letitia Michelle Wright has already carved quite an impressive career for herself in Hollywood. The actress was born on the 31st of October 1993 in Georgetown, Guyana, before moving to London with her family at the age of seven. However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wright experienced abuse from classmates for her accent,</a> something which she tried to change when she was younger.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>According to the actress herself, she was inspired to get into acting by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keke Palmer’s</a> performance in Akeelah and the Bee. At the age of 16, she enrolled in the Identity School of Acting In London, and from there, she was able to get numerous small parts in multiple British TV shows.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>Her early work as an actress included appearances in shows such as Holby City and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Top Boy</a> back in 2011 when she was just 17. She even made an appearance in an episode of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Who</a> in 2015 and, later on, she starred as Nish in “Black Museum,” arguably one of the best episodes of the Netflix show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Mirror.</a></p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Shortly after that, her first big break came with Black Panther in 2018. She played Princess Shuri, the younger sister of T’Challa (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chadwick Boseman</a>), and she quickly became a fan favorite due to her charismatic performance. Since her role as Princess Shuri in the MCU hit, Wright has appeared in numerous big-budget Hollywood productions including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Death on the Nile</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ready Player One.</a></p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=775 data-injectable=true>After Boseman’s untimely death in 2020, Wright was ultimately chosen to be the new Black Panther for the MCU, which was quite the promotion considering she had only really been a side character before. Although it was a tough role to fill, Wright&nbsp;did a great job at not only taking on the new mantle but doing so in a way that isn’t disrespectful to the actor who came before.</p><h2 id=h-how-much-did-wright-make-from-those-movies data-injectable=false>How much did Wright make from those movies?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Black_Panther-596683827-large-1-e1684933208247.jpeg><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=876 data-injectable=true>Wright’s earnings for the first Black Panther film have not been confirmed; however, she did make a cool $700,000 for her leading role in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Galore</a>. To be fair, you’d think that she would have earned a bit more for being the titular character in an MCU sequel (Chadwick Boseman earned $2 million for his role in the first movie). However, this is still probably one of her highest-earning roles in her career thus far with smaller jobs such as her voice work in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Illumination’s</a> Sing 2 only earning her around $150,000.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-letitia-wright-s-net-worth-now data-injectable=false>What is Letitia Wright’s net worth now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/75B4C712-9815-4F8E-9D49-39A6775CAD07.jpeg><p data-characters=624 data-current-count=924 data-injectable=true>Right now, Letitia Wright’s current net worth is reported to be around $4 million, which isn’t too bad considering she isn’t even 30 yet. Of course, that number will very likely go up as the actress bags more and more major roles in movies. Currently, we don’t have any updates regarding a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Panther 3</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wright herself has no clue what’s happening with it.</a> However, it’s safe to say if Marvel decides to make a third installment, Shuri will likely be taking the lead. Aside from that, she’ll also probably return as the Black Panther for the upcoming Avengers films: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Kang Dynasty</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Secret Wars.</a></p><h2 id=h-what-else-do-we-know-about-wright data-injectable=false>What else do we know about Wright?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/E3DE5D2A-1126-4E9B-860A-0FCEFB77C418.jpeg><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>Wright is a Christian and she partially credits her acting success to her faith. According to her interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian,</a> she felt “empty” and it almost led to her quitting acting. Wright turned to Christianity, which helped her find the contentment that she needed to not only return to her profession but flourish in it.</p><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=false>Letitia is 5’5” or 1.65 meters tall. She is currently single, although a while back, there were rumors that the MCU star was dating <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Boyega</a> — but those rumors were never confirmed. There were even rumors that she was dating model Eva Apio after the two changed their profile pics to each other’s faces on Twitter, although it seems like they’re just friends. For now, the actress has stated that she’s happy to wait for love as she’s apparently not using any dating apps.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S5psDIraCaZaentqi002alnqxdrLyzwMdmmKCdXZ2yqrPHrWSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdqMGiwNSsZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fletitia-wright-net-worth-age-height-relationship-status.html&text=Letitia%20Wrights%20net%20worth%2c%20age%2c%20height%2c%20and%20relationship%20status&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fletitia-wright-net-worth-age-height-relationship-status.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fletitia-wright-net-worth-age-height-relationship-status.html&title=Letitia%20Wrights%20net%20worth%2c%20age%2c%20height%2c%20and%20relationship%20status" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fletitia-wright-net-worth-age-height-relationship-status.html&title=Letitia%20Wrights%20net%20worth%2c%20age%2c%20height%2c%20and%20relationship%20status" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fletitia-wright-net-worth-age-height-relationship-status.html&title=Letitia%20Wrights%20net%20worth%2c%20age%2c%20height%2c%20and%20relationship%20status" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fletitia-wright-net-worth-age-height-relationship-status.html&description=Letitia%20Wrights%20net%20worth%2c%20age%2c%20height%2c%20and%20relationship%20status" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michelle-ongkingco.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michelle Ongkingco">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chris-brown-roasted-tantrum-grammys-loss.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Brown was predictably roasted for throwing a tantrum over his Grammys loss">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
