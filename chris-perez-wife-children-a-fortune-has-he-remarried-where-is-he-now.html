Selena’s death completely ruined Chris psychologically and emotionally.&nbsp;It was so damaging to him that he started abusing drugs and consuming alcohol in excess.</span></p><p><span>Years passed, Chris got a little sober, he started a band he called the Chris Pérez band.&nbsp;He released his debut album,&nbsp;</span><span>Resurrection</span><span>&nbsp;which won him a Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock Album.&nbsp;The band soon broke up right after the release of their second album.&nbsp;</span><i><span>Una Noche Mas&nbsp;</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Since then, he tried to commit to a long-term project, but it didn’t work out.&nbsp;He moved to&nbsp;</span><span>Kings of Kumbia</span><span>&nbsp;which lasted from 2003-2006 and then to&nbsp;</span><span>Kumbia All Stars</span><span>which lasted longer than the old one, from 2006-2011.&nbsp;His lack of progress has been blamed on his fans and the media for his full recovery from his unending grief for his late wife Selena.&nbsp;And the facts supporting that claim seemed to be true.&nbsp;In 2012, he wrote and published a book called&nbsp;</span><span>To Selena, With Love.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wife, has he remarried?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Chris married fellow bandmate and frontman Selena Quintanilla on April 2, 1992. The couple were known to be happily married, but that bliss was quickly cut short on March 31, 1995, just two days before their third anniversary as a married couple, Selena was murdered by her former friend Yolanda Saldivar.&nbsp;Her death greatly affected Chris’ acting, which to this day has shown that he has yet to fill the void left by Selena.</span></p><p><span>But he still had to move on, and in 1996 his friend John Garza introduced him to Vanessa Villanueva.&nbsp;The couple began dating in 1998 and eventually got married in 2001. The couple had two children, Cassie Pérez their daughter and Noah Pérez their son.&nbsp;Villanueva filed for divorce in 2008, citing irreconcilable differences in their marriage.&nbsp;At first, a close friend of Vanessa said she never wanted a divorce and chose to work through their differences.&nbsp;But in 2008, the couple divorced.</span></p><p><span>Chris never lost touch with the Quintanilla family.&nbsp;Even though he was married to Villanueva and had two children with her, he always made sure to keep in touch with Selena’s family.</span></p><p><span>Pérez is currently engaged to Melissa Jimenez, a singer and songwriter.&nbsp;Jimenez confirmed the engagement on her Instagram page by posting a photo of her engagement ring.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Kids</span></strong></h2><p><span>Chris has two children, daughter Cassie Pérez and son Noah Pérez, both from his second marriage to Vanessa Villanueva.&nbsp;Chris never had a child from his first marriage to Selena.&nbsp;He denied rumors that Selena was pregnant when she was killed.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Chris has earned $1.2 million from various songs, shows, awards and nominations.&nbsp;It won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock Album.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Where is he now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Chris currently lives in Los Angeles where he is focusing on his music career and being the father of his two adult children.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGibmKe2tHnPnqmesl2stqexjJyfoqSUp7KvecBmnaiqpKq7pnnHmqpmoJViv6a5wKupop2UYsSpsdGeZKKrXZ2ybrrOsGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchris-perez-wife-children-a-fortune-has-he-remarried-where-is-he-now.html&text=Chris%20Prez%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20A%20fortune%2c%20Has%20he%20remarried%2c%20Where%20is%20he%20now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchris-perez-wife-children-a-fortune-has-he-remarried-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchris-perez-wife-children-a-fortune-has-he-remarried-where-is-he-now.html&title=Chris%20Prez%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20A%20fortune%2c%20Has%20he%20remarried%2c%20Where%20is%20he%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchris-perez-wife-children-a-fortune-has-he-remarried-where-is-he-now.html&title=Chris%20Prez%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20A%20fortune%2c%20Has%20he%20remarried%2c%20Where%20is%20he%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchris-perez-wife-children-a-fortune-has-he-remarried-where-is-he-now.html&title=Chris%20Prez%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20A%20fortune%2c%20Has%20he%20remarried%2c%20Where%20is%20he%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchris-perez-wife-children-a-fortune-has-he-remarried-where-is-he-now.html&description=Chris%20Prez%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20A%20fortune%2c%20Has%20he%20remarried%2c%20Where%20is%20he%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./250669-evelyn-lozadas-ex-chad-ochocinco-engaged-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Evelyn Lozada's Ex Chad Ochocinco Engaged  Fans Think His Fiance Looks like the BBWLA Star">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./aladdin-star-breaks-silence-on-ezra-bridger-rumors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aladdin Star Breaks Silence On Ezra Bridger Rumors">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
