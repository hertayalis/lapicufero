Coleman has an excellent resume that includes at least one of your favorite shows.</strong><strong> He’s a well-known television actor who has played a variety of roles over the last three decades.</strong></p><p><strong>When the cameras aren’t rolling, the big man is all about his children.</strong><strong> Chad is an amazing father that prioritizes his family above all else.</strong></p><p>So, how is life in the Coleman household?</p><h2>Meet the Children of Chad L. Coleman</h2><p>Chad is the proud father of two amazing children. He has a daughter named SaCha Stewart-Coleman and a son named Caleb. Chad is currently unmarried, but he has a wonderful girlfriend who assists him in raising his children.</p><p>He is currently in a relationship with Tracy, with whom he is raising their son Caleb. Caleb assures us that they are excellent parents to their children.</p><p>Chad posted photos of his girlfriend and son on Tracy’s birthday and remarked, “You’re an incredible mother!</p><p><strong>“THE BEST MOMMIE EVER!” exclaims Caleb.</strong></p><p>Similarly, Coleman enjoys posting lovely moments with his children on social media. From concerts to sports to holidays to birthdays, he is always present to spend quality time with his children.</p><p>He refers to his son as “King Caleb,” and he treats him as such. Furthermore, he considers his children to be the most amazing things in his life.</p><p>On Twitter, he posted a nice selfie with his children and wrote,</p><p><strong>“The two most amazing humans in my life that I’m most thankful for!”</strong></p><p>His daughter SaCha, on the other hand, has grown up and followed in her father’s footsteps. She also pursued acting and began her career on Broadway.</p><p>He posted a picture of his daughter on her birthday, expressing his pride in her.</p><p><strong>“From sitting on Daddy’s lap to your first day of school to Broadway, my firstborn!”</strong></p><p>We are the only father/daughter actors that made our Broadway debuts in the same season, 2009-10!</p><p><strong>I’m really proud of you!</strong><br><strong>“I adore you to the core of my being,” he wrote.</strong></p><p>Sally Stewart, Chad’s ex-wife, gave birth to SaCha. They married in 1999 but did not last long as a pair. As a result, after more than a decade of marriage, they divorced in 2010. Chad is a family man, and his children are his priority.</p><p>But his generosity extends beyond his own family. He is an outspoken supporter of adoption and foster care for underprivileged children.<br>He has a personal connection to the subject because he was a foster child in his adolescence.</p><p>As a result, he has teamed up with organizations like Living Advantage to raise awareness and funds for children in the foster care system.</p><h2>More about Chad L. Coleman’s Youth</h2><p>Chad L. Coleman was born in the city of Richmond, Virginia. He spent his childhood living with his grandma and in foster care facilities. He also served in the United States Army before turning to act.</p><p>Since the beginning of his career in the 1990s, he has received widespread acclaim for his roles in successful shows such as ‘The Wire,’ ‘The Walking Dead,’ ‘It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,’ ‘The Expanse,’ and many others.</p><p>He now enjoys a wonderful life with his family and an amazing career that is reaching new heights.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
