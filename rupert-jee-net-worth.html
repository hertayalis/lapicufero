More, he is the owner of the store Hello Deli, in which usually the show is being shot. Jee has been active in the entertainment industry since 1993.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Rupert Jee? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the outright size of his wealth is as much as $500,000, as of the data presented in the middle of 2017. Television is one of the sources of Jee’s net worth, as he earns nearly $ 225,000 annually from royalties associated with the show, as well as revenue from the store.</p><h3>Rupert Jee Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>To begin with, the boy grew up in New York City, the son of Chinese immigrants. Rupert Jee graduated from the City University of New York, in which he majored in Economics earning a Bachelor’s degree.</p><p>Concerning his professional career, Jee became known through his many guest appearances in “The Late Show with <a href=#>David Letterman</a>”. The first time he joined the Show was in 1993 in a segment dedicated to greeting the neighbours, and since then has been a frequent guest to be seen in the show. Most of the show’s competitions for ordinary people take place in his store – Hello Deli – and he also occasionally participates in fun things, such as having headsets and following all Letterman’s orders. In the summer of 2006, a large advertising poster, which actually depicted singer <a href=#>Rod Stewart</a>, was acquired by <a href=#>Letterman’s</a> show, and changed so that Rupert Jee’s head was placed on Stewart’s body. Furthermore, there were other challenges to various broadcast segments, but they did little harm to the popularity of the show including Rupert Jee!</p><p>As previously mentioned, Rupert Jee is the owner of the store Hello Deli. Many of the sandwiches you can buy from him have names inspired by the show, or other celebrities. Among other things you can buy a sandwich entitled <a href=#>David Letterman</a> himself, <a href=#>Paul Shaffer</a> and <a href=#>Regis Philbin</a>.</p><p>To summarise, all the previously mentioned engagements have added sums to the total size of Rupert Jee’s net worth. More, participation in the “Late Show with <a href=#>David Letterman</a>” made him famous and certainly helped his business to expand.</p><p>Additionally, Jee is known to be trading on the stock market.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of Rupert Jee, he is probably single – he reveals few details about his private affairs. He says he likes fishing, playing Ping Pong as well as surfing the Internet.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.721798780488><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Rupert Jee</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 16, 1956</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 6" (1.68 m)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Businessman, Entrepreneur, television celebrity, TV show host, Owner of Hello Deli</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>City University of New York</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=0.31111111111111><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/hello_deli?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/6937669/hello-deli/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0420081</a></td></tr><tr readability=13><td>TV Shows</td><td>Late Show with David Letterman: Meet the Neighbors (1993), Late Show with David Letterman (1997-2015), Kenny & vänner (2008), American Stag (2006, Documentary), Ed (2003, TV Series), The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (2016), Hello-Deli Web site!, Fun with Rupert</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=8.2182320441989><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=5.2741935483871><td>1</td><td>[on if he watches <a href=#>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a> (1992)] Never.
